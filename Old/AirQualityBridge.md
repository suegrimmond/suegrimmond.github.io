Air Quality monitoring at Strand Campus

CO2 – Two closed path gas analysers Li840 (Campbell Scientific) in vicinity of EC flux towers and one open path Li7500 gas analyser on the flux tower.
FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy) – monitoring concentrations of airpollutants (CO2, CO, CH4, SO2, NH3, O3) over a certain path length (e.g. across a street canyon).
